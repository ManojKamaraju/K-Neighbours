# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

## Overview
The **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm is a simple yet powerful **supervised learning algorithm** used for classification and regression tasks. It works by identifying the 'K' closest data points in the feature space and making predictions based on majority voting (for classification) or averaging (for regression).

## How KNN Works
1. **Choose K**: Select the number of neighbors (K) to consider for classification or regression.
2. **Measure Distance**: Compute the distance between the query point and all other data points in the dataset using a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski).
3. **Identify Neighbors**: Select the K closest data points based on the computed distances.
4. **Make Predictions**:
   - **Classification**: Assign the class label that appears most frequently among the K neighbors (majority voting).
   - **Regression**: Compute the average (or weighted average) of the numerical values of the K neighbors.

## Distance Metrics
KNN relies on a distance function to find the nearest neighbors:
- **Euclidean Distance**: 
  \[ d(p, q) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (q_i - p_i)^2} \]
- **Manhattan Distance**: 
  \[ d(p, q) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |q_i - p_i| \]
- **Minkowski Distance**: 
  \[ d(p, q) = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |q_i - p_i|^p \right)^{\frac{1}{p}} \]

## Choosing the Value of K
- **Small K (e.g., K=1, K=3)**: Model is sensitive to noise and overfits the training data.
- **Large K (e.g., K=10, K=15)**: Reduces overfitting but may oversmooth decision boundaries.
- **Optimal K**: Typically found using cross-validation.

## Advantages of KNN
✔️ Simple and easy to implement.
✔️ No prior assumptions about data distribution.
✔️ Works well with multi-class classification problems.
✔️ Can be used for classification and regression tasks.

## Disadvantages of KNN
❌ Computationally expensive for large datasets (due to distance calculations).
❌ Sensitive to irrelevant or redundant features.
❌ Performance depends on the choice of distance metric and K value.

## Applications of KNN
- **Image Recognition**: Used for handwritten digit recognition (e.g., MNIST dataset).
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Classifying diseases based on patient symptoms.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Finding similar users or products.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying fraudulent transactions or unusual data patterns.

## Conclusion
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a highly intuitive method for classification and regression. While it is effective for smaller datasets, its performance may degrade with large-scale data due to high computational costs. Proper feature scaling, distance metric selection, and choosing an optimal K value are key factors in improving KNN's effectiveness.
